Solving Sustainability Challenge - Mitigating Partial Shading Issues on PV System Configurations Using AI ML

# Overview
This project focuses on developing a dynamic reconfiguration system for optimizing the efficiency of photovoltaic (PV) arrays under partial shading conditions. The system utilizes machine learning algorithms integrated within the MATLAB and Simulink framework to dynamically adjust the positioning of PV modules in real-time. By overcoming the limitations of static reconfiguration, the goal is to enhance overall energy output and reliability in solar energy systems.

# Key Features
- Integration of machine learning algorithms for real-time analysis of PV array data.
- Dynamic reconfiguration of PV modules based on shading patterns and sunlight intensity.
- Simulation and validation of system performance in Simulink before deployment.
- Potential for fine-tuning algorithms and exploring additional features post-deployment.
- Application across residential, commercial, and utility-scale solar installations.
